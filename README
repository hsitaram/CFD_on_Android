This software is for use on Android operating systems and is a bare bones
implementation of a potential flow solver. 

Potential flow solution can be obtained by solving the Laplace equation with 
appropriate uniform flow and wall boundary conditions for stream function.

The triangle mesher and solver are written in C++ and a first order triangle
element is used in the finite element formulation. The matrix solve is
done via matrix-free gmres with Jacobi preconditioning.

The graphics rendering is done using android's opengl es.
